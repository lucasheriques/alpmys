# Alpmys - Event Management System

Hello, and welcome to our project: Alpmys!

This repository contains all files related to the project. Following, we describe the directory structure:

- **/code**: contains all the application coding, frontend and backend
- **/deliverables**: each subdirectory on this marks the end of a sprint (look for the commit). On each directory, we put all files that we need to deliver on Edmodo for our teachers.
- **/documentation**: contains all documentation files (system architecture, requeriments, user stories...)
- **/project-management**: contains all information related to the project management (scope definition, WBS, schedule...)
- **/study-material**: contains references to all study materials that we used in the making of this project
- **/templates**: contains the templates that we used for the project or documentation files

Each folder has subfolders dividing files even more, and we detail those in each respect folder.
